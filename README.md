# realtime-lane-detection
A real-time lane detection system built using Python and OpenCV. It processes webcam/video/IP camera streams, detects lane boundaries using Canny + Hough Transform, applies smoothing, and visualizes lane regions with performance metrics—similar to basic ADAS lane assist in modern cars.
